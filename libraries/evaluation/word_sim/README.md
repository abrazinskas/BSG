# eval-word-vectors
Manaal Faruqui, mfaruqui@cs.cmu.edu

Easy-to-use scripts for evaluating word vectors on a variety of tasks.
These are the scripts that run behind the online tool on ```http://www.wordvectors.org/```.
I will be adding more evaluation scripts here over the course of time.

### Requirements
1. Python 2.7 (+numpy package)

### Data you need
1. Word vector file
2. Any word similarity evaluation file (if you are not using the provided ones)

Each vector file should have one word vector per line as follows (space delimited):-

```the -1.0 2.4 -0.3 ...```

### Evaluating on multiple word sim tasks

```python all_wordsim.py word_vec_file word_sim_file_dir```

```python all_wordsim.py skip-gram-vecs.txt data/word-sim/```

### Evaluating on one word sim task

```python wordsim.py word_vec_file word_sim_file```

```word_sim_file``` should be in the same format as files in ```data/word-sim/```

### Reference

Please make sure to cite the papers corresponding to the word similarity dataset that you are using. This
list of citation can be found at ```http://www.wordvectors.org/```.

Please cite the following paper if you use this tool:
